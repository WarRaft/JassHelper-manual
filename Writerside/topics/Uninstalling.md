# Uninstalling

## WEHelper plugin

Move `JASSHelper.dll` out of the plugins folder/delete it.

## Newgen pack/grimoire

I think removing the jasshelper folder would make it notice it was uninstalled.

## From your computer

jasshelper does not use the registry, so you can just wipe the folder containing it.
