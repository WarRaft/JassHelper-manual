# local variables

local variables are just like the global ones, they are even declared using the same syntax, the main difference is that
they are declared inside a function, and only the function can access them. In fact, function arguments are also local
variables.

You must declare local variables at the beginning of a function. You may not have sized or 2D arrays as locals.
